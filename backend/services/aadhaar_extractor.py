"""Aadhaar / ID portrait extraction (Upgrade 3).

Real users upload the *whole* card (or a phone photo of it), not a pre-cropped
face. This module isolates the portrait region so downstream alignment +
embedding operate on a clean, high-resolution face.

Design choice: extraction is **face-driven**, not layout-driven. Running the
detector across orientations and cropping around the strongest face is far more
robust to old/new Aadhaar layouts, scans, phone photos and perspective skew than
brittle template/contour heuristics — and it inherently validates that a face is
present. For small faces (a tiny portrait inside a big card photo) we upscale +
restore the portrait region and re-detect to recover detail before embedding.

No OCR / field extraction is performed (out of scope by request).
